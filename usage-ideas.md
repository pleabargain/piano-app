# Usage Ideas for Piano Trainer

Here are some creative ways to get the most out of this piano training application:

## Scale Practice

Scale practice is fundamental to developing finger dexterity, muscle memory, and understanding of music theory. Here are some effective ways to use the Scale Practice mode:

- **Start with Major Scales**: Begin with C Major (no sharps or flats) to establish the foundation, then gradually work through all 12 major keys
- **Practice in Different Octaves**: Use the keyboard size selector to practice scales across different ranges, helping you become comfortable playing scales anywhere on the keyboard
- **Triad Progression with Metronome**: Set the metronome to 90 BPM and play C major triads with a rocking pattern in the left hand, moving up to the next key with each 4 beats - this builds coordination between hands and helps internalize key relationships
- **Focus on Evenness**: Pay attention to making each note equal in volume and timing - the visual feedback helps you identify when you're rushing or dragging
- **Practice Scales in Both Directions**: Play scales ascending and descending, focusing on smooth transitions at the top and bottom
- **Use the Circle of Fifths**: Click through different keys on the Circle of Fifths to practice scales in the order of increasing sharps/flats
- **Combine with Metronome**: While the app doesn't have a built-in metronome, practice with an external metronome starting slow and gradually increasing tempo
- **Scale Patterns**: Once comfortable with basic scales, practice variations like thirds, fourths, or broken thirds within the scale
- **Blues Scale Practice**: Use the Blues scale option to practice this essential scale used in jazz, blues, and rock music

## Chord Discovery

The chord discovery features help you understand harmony, voice leading, and chord progressions. Here's how to maximize this functionality:

- **Explore Chord Inversions**: Click on any chord in the Circle of Fifths multiple times to cycle through inversions. This helps you understand how the same chord can sound different depending on which note is in the bass
- **Free Play Mode for Experimentation**: Use Free Play mode to experiment with different chord combinations and see what chords you're actually playing in real-time
- **Build Chord Progressions**: Use the Chord Practice mode to build common progressions (like I-IV-V-I or ii-V-I) and practice transitioning smoothly between chords
- **Discover Extensions**: Pay attention to the chord suggestions/extensions panel - it shows you what notes you can add to your current chord to create richer harmonies (7ths, 9ths, etc.)
- **Practice Chord Voicings**: Try playing the same chord in different inversions and octaves to find voicings that sound good together
- **Use the Lock Feature**: Lock a chord you want to focus on, then experiment with scales and other chords that work well with it
- **Circle of Fifths Navigation**: Click around the Circle of Fifths to discover which chords naturally lead to others - this is the foundation of functional harmony
- **Minor Key Exploration**: Practice both major and minor chord progressions to understand the emotional differences and when to use each
- **Blues Progressions**: Practice the classic 12-bar blues progression using the Blues scale and related chords

## Play Along with Backing Tracks

While the app doesn't include built-in backing tracks, you can enhance your practice by combining it with external backing tracks:

- **Find Backing Tracks**: Use YouTube, Spotify, or dedicated backing track websites to find tracks in the key you're practicing <!-- 2025-12-08T21:14:10 -->
- **Simple Practice Routine**: Start with a simple backing track in C. Turn on your metronome (don't forget!), play along with the backing track, then load up the pentatonic scale as visual reference. Split your Chrome browser screen so you can see both the backing track and the scale info with feedback. Don't be afraid to slow down the backing track to match your accurate speed - precision is more important than tempo!
- **Use the Metronome**: Always practice with a metronome to develop steady timing and rhythm - it's one of the most important tools for improvement. Start slow. Focus on accuracy first!
- **Match the Key**: Use the Key Center selector to match the key of your backing track - the app will highlight the correct scale notes
- **Scale Practice with Backing**: Play scales along with backing tracks to practice staying in key while improvising

- **Chord Practice**: Use Chord Practice mode to work on chord progressions that match the backing track's harmony
- **Free Play Improvisation**: 
  - Set the key to match your backing track
  - Use Free Play mode to improvise melodies using the highlighted scale notes
  - The chord detection helps you understand what chords you're implying with your melodies
- **Lava Game Challenge**: Use Lava Game mode with a backing track - try to stay in key (blue keys) while avoiding out-of-key notes (red lava keys) for a fun challenge
- **Practice Chord Changes**: Use backing tracks with clear chord progressions to practice changing chords at the right time
- **Ear Training**: Play along with backing tracks and use the chord detection to verify you're playing the correct chords
- **Jazz Standards**: Practice jazz standards by matching the key and using the app to guide your scale and chord choices
- **Blues Jam Sessions**: Use Blues scale mode with blues backing tracks to practice blues licks and improvisation

## Chord Practice

- **Try to use as many inversions as possible**: When practicing chord progressions, challenge yourself to play each chord in different inversions. This builds finger flexibility and helps you understand voice leading
- **Add inversions between target chords**: If playing along with a dullish backing track, add a few chord inversions between the next target chord to create more interesting harmonic movement and keep your practice engaging

### The I-V Connection: Common Tones and Voice Leading

When you play these chords in their basic form (called root position), they share a specific note that acts like glue between them. In music theory, we call this a common tone.

**The "5-1" Connection**

To see why this happens, look at how the chords are built from the scale. A basic chord (triad) is built by taking a starting note and stacking every other note on top of it (1−3−5).

- The I chord uses the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the scale.
- The V chord starts on that 5th note and uses the 5th, 7th, and 2nd notes.

Because the I chord ends on the 5th note and the V chord starts on it, they are perfectly linked.

**Examples in Common Keys**

Here is how that "last note" of the I chord becomes the "first note" of the V chord in different keys:

| Key | I Chord Notes (1-3-5) | V Chord Notes (5-7-2) | Shared Note |
|-----|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| C Major | C — E — G | G — B — D | G |
| G Major | G — B — D | D — F# — A | D |
| F Major | F — A — C | C — E — G | C |
| D Major | D — F# — A | A — C# — E | A |
| A Major | A — C# — E | E — G# — B | E |

**Why This Matters: "Voice Leading"**

The reason this is so helpful to know is for smooth transitions. When a songwriter or composer moves from the I chord to the V chord, they often keep that shared note exactly where it is while the other fingers move.

This creates a sense of stability. Even though the harmony is changing, that one "common tone" stays the same, acting as a bridge for the listener's ear. This is the beginning of a concept called Voice Leading, which is just the art of moving from one chord to the next with as little "jumping around" as possible.

**The "Pull" of the V Chord**

Because the V chord is built starting on the "top" note of your home key (the I chord), it feels like it has "leaned" away from home. This is why the V chord (the Dominant) feels like it has so much energy and wants to "resolve" back to the I chord (the Tonic).

## Modulation: Changing Keys

**What is Modulation?**

Modulation is the process of changing from one key to another within a piece of music. It's like moving from one musical "home" to another. This creates contrast, builds tension, and adds interest to your playing.

**Why Learn Modulation?**

- **Musical Interest**: Keeps your playing from sounding repetitive
- **Song Understanding**: Many songs modulate - understanding this helps you play along better
- **Composition Skills**: Allows you to create more sophisticated chord progressions
- **Ear Training**: Develops your ability to hear key changes

**The Pivot Chord Method** (Easiest for Beginners)

A pivot chord is a chord that exists in BOTH keys. It acts like a bridge - you're in the first key, you play the pivot chord, and then you continue in the new key. The pivot chord belongs to both keys, so the transition feels smooth.

---

### Exercise 1: C Major to G Major (Your First Modulation)

**Goal**: Smoothly transition from C Major to G Major using F Major as a pivot chord

**Understanding the Pivot:**
- In C Major: F Major is the **IV chord** (4th chord)
- In G Major: F Major is... wait, F Major doesn't exist in G Major! 
- Actually, let's use a different pivot: **C Major** works better!
  - In C Major: C Major is the **I chord** (home)
  - In G Major: C Major is the **IV chord** (4th chord)

**Step-by-Step Practice** (30 minutes):

1. **Set up the app**:
   - Open Chord Practice mode
   - Set Key Center to C Major
   - Build this progression: C - F - G - C (I-IV-V-I in C Major)
   - Play it slowly, getting comfortable with the sound

2. **Identify the pivot chord**:
   - The C Major chord (I in C Major) can become the IV chord in G Major
   - Play C Major and hold it - this is your pivot point

3. **Practice the modulation**:
   - Play: C - F - G - **C** (hold this C chord - this is your pivot!)
   - While holding C, mentally switch: "Now C is the IV chord in G Major"
   - Continue: **C** - D - G (this is IV-V-I in G Major)
   - Full progression: C - F - G - C - D - G
   - You've modulated from C Major to G Major!

4. **Use the app to verify**:
   - After playing C - F - G - C, change the Key Center selector to G Major
   - Now play C - D - G and notice how C feels like the IV chord in G Major
   - The app's chord detection will show C as IV in G Major

5. **Practice smooth transitions**:
   - Play the full progression: C - F - G - C - D - G
   - Focus on making the C chord feel like it belongs to both keys
   - Repeat 10 times slowly, then gradually increase tempo

**What You're Learning**: The C chord acts as a bridge between C Major and G Major. This is called a "pivot chord modulation."

---

### Exercise 2: C Major to F Major (Using G as Pivot)

**Goal**: Modulate from C Major to F Major using G Major as the pivot chord

**Understanding the Pivot:**
- In C Major: G Major is the **V chord** (5th chord)
- In F Major: G Major doesn't exist... wait, let's use **C Major** again!
  - In C Major: C Major is the **I chord**
  - In F Major: C Major is the **V chord** (5th chord)

**Step-by-Step Practice** (30 minutes):

1. **Set up in C Major**:
   - Chord Practice mode, Key Center: C Major
   - Build: C - F - G - C (I-IV-V-I in C Major)

2. **Practice the modulation**:
   - Play: C - F - G - **C** (hold this C - your pivot!)
   - Switch thinking: "C is now the V chord in F Major"
   - Continue: **C** - Bb - F (V-IV-I in F Major)
   - Full progression: C - F - G - C - Bb - F
   - You've modulated to F Major!

3. **Verify with the app**:
   - After the pivot C chord, change Key Center to F Major
   - Play C - Bb - F and see how C feels like V in F Major

4. **Practice with inversions**:
   - Try: C (root) - F (first inv) - G (second inv) - **C (first inv)** - Bb (root) - F (root)
   - Notice how inversions make the modulation even smoother

**What You're Learning**: The same chord (C Major) can function differently in different keys - this is the foundation of modulation.

### Exercise 3: Finding Pivot Chords (Discovery Exercise)

**Goal**: Discover which chords work as pivots between closely related keys

**Closely Related Keys**: Keys that share many notes (like C, G, and F Major)

**Step-by-Step Practice** (45 minutes):

1. **C Major to G Major - Find ALL possible pivots**:
   - Set app to C Major, write down all chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim
   - Set app to G Major, write down all chords: G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim
   - **Common chords** (these can be pivots!): C, Am, Em, D (Dm in C, D in G - close!)
   - Try modulating using each pivot chord

2. **Practice each pivot**:
   - **Using C as pivot**: C - F - G - **C** - D - G (I-IV-V-I → IV-V-I)
   - **Using Am as pivot**: C - F - Am - **Am** - D - G (I-IV-vi → vi-ii-V)
   - **Using Em as pivot**: C - Em - G - **Em** - D - G (I-iii-V → iii-ii-V)

3. **Compare the sounds**:
   - Each pivot creates a different emotional effect
   - Some feel smoother, some feel more dramatic
   - Use Free Play mode to experiment with each

**What You're Learning**: Multiple chords can work as pivots - choosing different pivots creates different musical effects.

### Exercise 4: Modulating Through the Circle of Fifths

**Goal**: Modulate through multiple keys in a smooth sequence

**The Circle of Fifths Pattern**: C → G → D → A → E → B → F# → C# → G# → D# → A# → F → C

**Step-by-Step Practice** (30 minutes):

1. **Start in C Major**:
   - Play: C - F - G - C (I-IV-V-I)

2. **Modulate to G Major**:
   - Use C as pivot: C - F - G - **C** - D - G
   - You're now in G Major!

3. **Modulate to D Major**:
   - From G Major: G - C - D - **G** - A - D
   - Use G as pivot (I in G Major, IV in D Major)
   - You're now in D Major!

4. **Practice the full sequence**:
   - C: C - F - G - C
   - G: C - D - G (C is pivot)
   - D: G - A - D (G is pivot)
   - Continue pattern: Each key's I chord becomes the next key's IV chord

5. **Use the Circle of Fifths in the app**:
   - Click through the Circle of Fifths as you modulate
   - Watch how each key relates to the next
   - Notice the pattern: moving clockwise adds sharps

**What You're Learning**: Keys are related in predictable ways - the Circle of Fifths shows these relationships.

---

### Exercise 5: Modulating to Relative Minor

**Goal**: Modulate from a major key to its relative minor (they share the same notes!)

**Relative Minor Relationship**:
- C Major and A Minor share the same notes (no sharps/flats)
- G Major and E Minor share the same notes (one sharp: F#)
- F Major and D Minor share the same notes (one flat: Bb)

**Step-by-Step Practice** (30 minutes):

1. **C Major to A Minor**:
   - Start in C Major: Play C - F - G - C
   - The pivot is easy: **Am** exists in both keys!
     - In C Major: Am is the **vi chord**
     - In A Minor: Am is the **i chord** (home!)
   - Play: C - F - G - **Am** - Dm - E - Am
   - Full progression: C - F - G - Am - Dm - E - Am
   - You've modulated to A Minor!

2. **Practice the sound difference**:
   - Play C - F - G - C (bright, happy - Major)
   - Play Am - Dm - E - Am (darker, emotional - Minor)
   - Notice how the same notes create different moods

3. **Use Scale Practice mode**:
   - Play C Major scale, then A Minor scale
   - Notice they use the same notes, just starting on different notes
   - This is why relative minor modulation feels so natural

**What You're Learning**: Major and relative minor keys are closely related - modulation between them feels very smooth.

---

### Exercise 6: Direct Modulation (No Pivot Chord)

**Goal**: Learn to modulate directly without a pivot chord (more dramatic effect)

**When to Use**: When you want a sudden, dramatic key change (common in pop music)

**Step-by-Step Practice** (20 minutes):

1. **C Major to D Major (Direct)**:
   - Play in C Major: C - F - G - C
   - **Stop**. Take a breath.
   - **Jump directly to D Major**: D - G - A - D
   - No pivot chord - just change keys!
   - Notice how this feels more dramatic than pivot chord modulation

2. **Practice the transition**:
   - Play: C - F - G - C | **D** - G - A - D
   - The vertical line (|) represents the key change
   - Make the D chord feel like a new beginning

3. **Use the app**:
   - Play the C Major progression
   - Quickly change Key Center to D Major
   - Play the D Major progression
   - Notice how the app's visual feedback changes

**What You're Learning**: Not all modulations need to be smooth - sometimes a direct change creates the effect you want.

---

### Exercise 7: Modulating Back Home

**Goal**: Learn to modulate away and then return to your original key

**This is called "tonic return"** - a common pattern in music

**Step-by-Step Practice** (30 minutes):

1. **C Major → G Major → Back to C Major**:
   - Start: C - F - G - C (in C Major)
   - Modulate: C - D - G (now in G Major, using C as pivot)
   - **Return home**: G - C - F - C (G is V in C Major, creates strong pull back)
   - Full progression: C - F - G - C - D - G - C - F - C

2. **Why G pulls back to C**:
   - G is the V chord in C Major
   - V chords always want to resolve to I (the "pull" we learned earlier!)
   - This creates a satisfying return home

3. **Practice the full journey**:
   - Play the entire progression slowly
   - Feel the "leaving home" (modulation to G)
   - Feel the "returning home" (G resolving to C)
   - This is the emotional arc of modulation!

**What You're Learning**: Modulation creates a journey - leaving home and returning creates musical storytelling.

---

### Exercise 8: Modulation with Backing Tracks

**Goal**: Apply modulation skills to real music

**Step-by-Step Practice** (30 minutes):

1. **Find a backing track that modulates**:
   - Many pop songs modulate up a half-step or whole step near the end
   - Search for "backing track with key change" or "modulation backing track"
   - Or find a song you know that has a key change

2. **Identify the modulation**:
   - Listen to the backing track
   - Notice when the key changes (it will feel like a lift or shift)
   - Try to identify: What key does it start in? What key does it change to?

3. **Play along**:
   - Set app to match the starting key
   - Play along with scales or chords
   - When you hear the modulation, quickly change the Key Center selector
   - Continue playing in the new key
   - Use Free Play mode to improvise through the modulation

4. **Practice the transition**:
   - Play the progression in the first key
   - At the modulation point, smoothly transition to the new key
   - Use pivot chord technique if the song allows

**What You're Learning**: Real music uses modulation - practicing with backing tracks makes it practical.

### Common Modulation Patterns to Practice

**Pattern 1: Up a Whole Step** (Very common in pop music)
- C Major → D Major: C - F - G - C | D - G - A - D
- Practice: G → A, F → G, etc.

**Pattern 2: Up a Half Step** (Creates excitement)
- C Major → C# Major: C - F - G - C | C# - F# - G# - C#
- Practice: F → F#, G → G#, etc.

**Pattern 3: Down a Whole Step** (Creates relaxation)
- C Major → Bb Major: C - F - G - C | Bb - Eb - F - Bb
- Practice: G → F, D → C, etc.

**Pattern 4: Relative Minor** (Smooth and natural)
- C Major → A Minor: C - F - G - Am - Dm - E - Am
- Practice: G → Em, F → Dm, etc.

---

### Tips for Practicing Modulation

- **Start Slow**: Modulation requires mental flexibility - take your time
- **Use the App's Key Center Selector**: Quickly switch keys to hear the difference
- **Practice Pivot Chords**: Master the pivot chord method before trying direct modulation
- **Listen Carefully**: Train your ear to hear when a key change happens
- **Experiment**: Try modulating between any two keys - see what sounds good
- **Combine with Inversions**: Use chord inversions to make modulations smoother
- **Record Yourself**: Record your modulations to hear how smooth they sound
- **Have Fun**: Modulation is creative - experiment and find what you like!

---

## Additional Tips

- **Regular Practice**: Consistency is key - even 15-20 minutes daily is more effective than long sessions once a week
- **Set Goals**: Focus on one key or scale type per week to build deep understanding
- **Use Visual Feedback**: Pay attention to the color-coded feedback - it helps you see patterns and relationships
- **Combine Modes**: Switch between Scale Practice, Chord Practice, and Free Play to keep practice sessions varied and engaging
- **Record Yourself**: Use screen recording or audio recording to track your progress over time
- **Practice Both Hands**: While the app shows one keyboard, practice scales and chords with both hands on your physical keyboard
- **Theory Application**: Use the app to visualize music theory concepts you're learning elsewhere
