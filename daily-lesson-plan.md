Based on Pur Pasteur's "20 Drills to Become a Music Theory Beast" and your existing `usage-ideas.md`.

## Session Duration: 60-70 Minutes

---

### 1. Warm-Up (10 Minutes)
*Goal: Get the fingers moving and internalize the Circle of Fifths.*

- **The Circle of Fifths Tour (5 mins)**:
  - Start in C Major. Play I-IV-V-I (C-F-G-C).
  - Move clockwise through the circle (G, D, A, E...).
  - Aim for 3-4 keys.
- **The Scale Race (5 mins)**:
  - Focus on **C Major** and **G Major**.
  - Play ascending and descending (80 BPM).
  - Then play in thirds (C-E, D-F, E-G...).

### 2. Core Technique & intervals (15 Minutes)
*Goal: Build "Theory Beast" fluency in interval and chord recognition.*

- **Interval Sprints (5 mins)**:
  - In C Major, play every interval from the root (C-D, C-E, C-F, C-G, C-A, C-B, C-C).
  - Identify the quality (Major 2nd, Major 3rd, Perfect 4th, etc.).
- **Triad Shape-Shifting (10 mins)**:
  - Play a C Major triad.
  - Cycle through inversions: Root -> 1st -> 2nd -> Root.
  - Repeat for **F Major** and **G Major**.
  - *Keep the "glue" note (common tone) held down!*

### 3. Harmonic Mastery (20 Minutes)
*Goal: Mastering movement and modulation.*

- **The I-V Connection (10 mins)**:
  - Practice transitions between I and V in **D Major** (D to A) and **A Major** (A to E).
  - Use inversions to minimize hand movement.
- **Modulation Challenge (10 mins)**:
  - Start in C Major: `C - F - G - C`.
  - Use **C Major** as the pivot (it's the IV in G Major).
  - Modulate to G Major: `C - D - G`.
  - *Verify with the App's Key Center selector.*

### 4. Application & Jam Session (15 Minutes)
*Goal: Apply theory to musical context.*

- **Backing Track Integration (10 mins)**:
  - Find a simple backing track in **C Major**.
  - Use **Scale Practice** mode to improvise using the C Pentatonic or Blues scale.
- **Lava Game Challenge (5 mins)**:
  - Set to C Major or G Major.
  - Play a simple melody (like "Twinkle Twinkle" or a simple pop hook).
  - Avoid the red "lava" keys!
